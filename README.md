Coca Cola's move to make thier contributions/projects/research funding public is a big step for a major corporation, it's too bad the data is relegated to an HTML table. 

This simple Python script uses the BeautifulSoup and Requests module to take data from Coca Cola's transparency page and turn it into a CSV that could be used for analysis. 

If you want just the data, you can pull it [here] (https://github.com/cximran/CocaColaTransparency/blob/master/Coca%20Cola%20Transparency%20Page.csv)
